1666748955:The Worlds 57th Best Raccoon Reviewer:Honestly, look at this picture and I feel like this raccoon just gives off bad vibes. For one, the bananas around it's head are most definitely not culturally appropriate, and could get it cancelled. This raccoon is also not very photogenic, and I feel like the modelling job done here is subpar to say the least. Instead of scavenging for these low-paying gigs, this raccoon should try to pursue a higher education to secure a better future for it and it's offspring, should they want to have any. Speaking of offspring, this raccoon should stop being so "on that sigma grindset," as the kids say, and should instead live life more. They should get around and find other mates to, well, mate with. Overall this picture conveys a deep story of a "down bad" raccoon, and with this information that I have gathered I would rate this raccoon a 3/10.
